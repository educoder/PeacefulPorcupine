PeacefulPorcupine
=================

The peace bridge between UIC and ENCORE


Compiling & Running
-------------------

You will need scala 2.10.1 and sbt.

On OS X you can install these using:

`brew install scala sbt`

To run and compile:

`sbt run`

Currently all configuration values are hard-coded into `PeacefulPorcupine.scala`. This will hopefully change soon.
